- This lib handles the graph rendering for the synthesis client
- The way ngraph work is weird, and the implementation has some problems, so I'm
  trying to reduce its usage as we go.
- I'm already using a custom merge module, and ideally we should remove some
  other stuff

- When changing, keep in mind: 
  - Changes to modules are erased by npm install
  - The installed modules are not in the live repo
  - Changes to synthesis_graph.js are erased by npm start
